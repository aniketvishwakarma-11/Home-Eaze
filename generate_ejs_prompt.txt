You are an AI assistant helping with my Node.js + Express + EJS project.

I already have a `style.css` file in the `public` folder that is used across the project.  
Now I need you to generate **three EJS view files** in the `views` folder:  
1. `login.ejs`  
2. `register.ejs`  
3. `booking.ejs`  

### Requirements:
- All files must include proper HTML boilerplate with `<head>`, link to `/style.css`, and Bootstrap classes for responsiveness.  
- **Login Page (login.ejs):**
  - Form fields: `Email`, `Password`.
  - A styled submit button.
  - A link to "Register" if user doesn’t have an account.

- **Register Page (register.ejs):**
  - Form fields: `Name`, `Email`, `Password`, `Confirm Password`.
  - A styled submit button.
  - A link to "Login" if user already has an account.

- **Booking Page (booking.ejs):**
  - Form fields: `Booking Date` (date input), `Booking Time` (time input).
  - Dropdown/select for `Booking Type`: options should be `Hour`, `Day`, `Week`, `Month`.
  - A styled submit button.

### Styling Notes:
- All pages must have styling consistent with the rest of my project (`style.css` is already written).
- Forms should be centered inside a container with a shadow/rounded corners (Bootstrap `card` style is okay).
- Buttons should look clean, with hover effects.
- Responsive layout should work on desktop and mobile.

Now generate the code for:
- `views/login.ejs`
- `views/register.ejs`
- `views/booking.ejs`
